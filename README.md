## author-profiling

The task is to determine if the author of a Twitter feed is a fake news spreader (the shared task [Profiling Fake News Spreaders on Twitter](https://pan.webis.de/clef20/pan20-web/author-profiling.html)). The tweet feeds are in English and Spanish. The training data contains only 300 cases for each language. Combining convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks provided the best performance. The neural network models were implemented with Keras on Tensorflow.
